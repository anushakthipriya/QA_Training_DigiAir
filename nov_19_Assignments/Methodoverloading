Different Ways of Method Overloading in Java
	Changing the Number of Parameters.
	Changing Data Types of the Arguments.
	Changing the Order of the Parameters of Methods
Can we overload static methods? 
	The answer is ‘Yes’. We can have two or more static methods with the same name, but differences in input parameters.
We cannot overload two methods in Java if they differ only by static keyword (number of parameters and types of parameters are the same).
